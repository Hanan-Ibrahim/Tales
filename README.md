# Tales
In this tales app, the user will create his own story lines based on what the user chooses. This app can be customized to add your own tales because it uses MCV pattern. All you need to do is replace the tale strings and options  to provide an engaging story-telling experience of your own.  It was created by following Angela Yu's iOS course on Udemy with some amendments in the design.
